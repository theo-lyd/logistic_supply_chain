/* ADVANCED ANALYSIS & PREDICTIVE QUESTIONS
1. Disruption & Delay Prediction:
	- Predict likelihood of shipment delays using historical + live data (traffic, weather).
	- Identify top predictors (e.g. congestion spikes, previous delays).

2. Route & Schedule Optimization:
	- Recommend reroutes or reschedules to minimize fuel and delays under current forecasts.
	- Allocate loading/unloading windows based on warehouse capacity.

3. Demand Forecasting:
	- Forecast future transport capacity needs using seasonality and external indicators.

4. Driver Safety & Performance:
	- Predict safety incidents or inefficiency from driver behavior data.
	- Link behavior scores to fuel use or ETA variation for proactive training.

5. Proactive Equipment Management: Forecast equipment (forklift, dock) downtime from usage logs to schedule maintenance.
